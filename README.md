The Movie Aginator
-----
This is a program that will look through all movies showing in theaters, and calculate the average age of the cast for each movie. 

It uses a class to break up the work load into sensible parts. 

The movie list will come from fandango, the actor/actresses list and their ages will come from imdb.

Comments will be made throughout the code to provide further explanation.
