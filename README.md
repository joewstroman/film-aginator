The Movie Aginator
-----
This is a program that will look through all movies showing in theaters, and calculate the average age of the cast for each movie. 

It uses a few classes to break up the work load into more manageable forms in case parameters that can't be controlled are changed. 

The movie list will come from fandango, the actor/actresses will come from imdb and the ages will come from wikipedia.

Comments will be made throughout the code to provide further explanation.
