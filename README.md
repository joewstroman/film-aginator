The Movie Aginator

This is a program that will look through all movies showing in theaters, and calculate the average age of the cast for each movie. 

It uses a few classes to break up the work load into more manageable forms in case parameters that can't be controlled are changed. 

Comments will be made throughout the code to provide further explanation.
